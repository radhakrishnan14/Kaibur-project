### TASK3 WEB UI Forms(`kaiburr-frontend/`)

The frontend [kaiburr-frontend](kaiburr-frontend) is implemented with React 19, TypeScript, and Ant Design. It provides a user-friendly interface to create, search, delete, and execute tasks while displaying task execution outputs. Accessibility and usability have been prioritized for an optimal user experience.
