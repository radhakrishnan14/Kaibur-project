# Task 3: WEB UI Forms

**This is the second task in my assignment submission.**

---

## Task Overview

Created a modern WEB UI frontend for the backend application implemented in Task 1. The frontend is developed using React 19, TypeScript, and Ant Design. The user interface enables the creation, display, searching, deletion, and execution of task records. It also allows users to view command outputs directly through the UI.

---

## Features

- Intuitive forms for creating new tasks
- Search functionality for filtering tasks by name or other criteria
- List view to display all tasks with details (id, name, owner, command, executions)
- Ability to delete tasks with confirmation prompts
- Run commands and view task execution output within the application
- Real-time status notifications for user actions (success/errors)

---

## Tech Stack

- React 19 framework
- TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- Ant Design (AntD) as the UI component library

---

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the frontend folder.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Make sure the backend (Task 1) API is running and accessible.
5. Access the UI via [http://localhost:5137](http://localhost:5137)
